# Url shortener react example

TLDR : Try the demo [here](https://dolig.github.io/url-shortener-react-demo/)
.

## What is it?
This is a simple one page app build with react (and redux, and some other cool tech), which shorten URL.

Please note that shortened URLs don't work because it is only a front app.

## How to use?

First, clone this repository on your computer.

Then open a terminal and follow these steps (you need to have npm installed):

```sh
# Install all the dependancies with npm.
npm install

# ONLY if you don't have brunch installed : install it.
npm install -g brunch

# Launch the brunch server.
brunch watch --server # Long syntax
brunch w -s           # Short syntax
```

Then, open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333)
